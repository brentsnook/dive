- if there is no key, treat it as a deep key
  - snap off start of key and use it to retrieve value
    - first look for string, if key not there look for symbol, otherwise nil
  - if there is any key left and object responds to dive, pass on remainder of key
  - else return nil
- add dive method with require 'dive/noninvasive' - doesn't override []
- allow override of Hash [] by require 'dive'
- finish readme
- test with 1.8.7
- update change log
- publish to gem repo

-- LATER --

- allow setting of key with hash.dive('thing[x]') = 'value'
- add can_dive? method - checks if there is a key
- normal override overrides has_key? also
